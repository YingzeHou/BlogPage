# Smart Money Concepts

#### Supply Zone

Imbalance between supply and demand, where supply greatly exceeded demand --> Price Down

#### Demand Zone

Imbalance between supply and demand, where demand greatly exceeded supply --> Price Up

### How to find S/D Zone?

1. Find Momentum Drive: Look for large **Price Move** (Long, successive candle in one direction) --> Pay attention to **Momentum** (How fast is the price moving) --> **Absolute distance** (How far the price move before stopping in that direction)
2. Find the Base of Momentum Drive: Look for price area **before** the price explosion in one direction --> Last bearish price action before bullish move / Vice Versa **(The base is the when the orders placed are responsible for the strong move)**

### Finding Liquidity

How easily an asset can be bought or sold: Large Liquidity --> Orders can easily be absorbed by market (Easier to buy or sell)

Large institutional participant need to find large liquidity points to fill their large order. Therefore, they need to find traders who want to sell their positions --> Liquidity Spike (A spike in opposite direction at the origin of a strong price move --> retail traders get trapped)

### How to find opportunity?

1. Daily Highs & Lows
2. Weekly Highs & Lows
3. Obvious Swing Points
4. Boundaries of Ranges

Identify absorption of liquidity by bigger player: Look at candle closes & Momentum of moves

1. High of range is taken out?
2. Price quickly and aggressively falls back into the range?
3. Then, buy side liquidity above the ranges has been triggered and absorbed by smart money
