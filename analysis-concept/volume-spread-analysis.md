# Volume Spread Analysis

### Basic

Price Spread same as Volume --> Volume Validate Price --> Continuation

Price Spread opposite as Volume --> Volume Diverge Price --> Inverse Signal

#### Spread

The difference between opening and closing of the price (body of candle)

#### Volume

The frequency of transaction of the price change during a speicifc period of time

#### Above Average High Volume

Highest Volume in current session which is higher than average volume (20-period Moving Average)

## Wyckoff Theory

### Accumulation

Supply and demand are in balance to each other after a MARK DOWN move

### Mark Up

Demand is higher than supply causing upward bullish rally

### Distribution

Supply and demand are in balance to each other after a MARK UP move

### Mark Down

Demand is lower causing downward bearish rally

## Sign of Strength (SOS)

Seller exhausted (demand low) after downtrend and Buyer increase (Demand increase) --> Market rise

### 1. Down Thrust

**Bullish pin bar or Doji bar** with **Low spread** with **ultra-high volume** --> More demand than supply

{% hint style="info" %}
Bullish Pin bar; Spread Low; Volume High
{% endhint %}

### 2. Selling Climax

**High spread** bearish candle with downward rejection wick (Large Body with Long Wick candles) with **high volume** --> Wick is about 25%\~50% of body --> More demand than supply

{% hint style="info" %}
Bearish Candle; Spread High; Volume High
{% endhint %}

### 3. Bearish Effort < Bearish Result&#x20;

**Spread** is **larger** than previous but **volume** is **lower** than previous --> Increase demand and reduce supply --> Market rise

{% hint style="info" %}
Spread Higher; Volume Lower
{% endhint %}

### 4. Bearish Effort > Bearish Result

**Bearish Candle with Spread** is **lower** than previous but **volume** is **higher** than previous --> Demand be more than supply --> Price rise&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Bearish Candle; Spread Lower; Volume Higher
{% endhint %}

### 5. No Supply Bar

**Low spread candle** having **downward wick** whose volume is **lower** than previous **two** volume --> Lack of supply and demand is overpowering --> Price rise (**Continuation Signal, not Reversal Signal**)

{% hint style="info" %}
Spread Low; Volume Lower
{% endhint %}

### 6. Pseudo Down Thrust

**Bullish pin bar** (Long lower wick than upper wick) **or doji bar** (Open and Close almost equal candle) having **low** spread with volume **lower** than previous **two** --> No supply or lack of supply (**Continuation Signal**)

{% hint style="info" %}
Bullish Pin Bar; Spread Low; Volume Lower
{% endhint %}

### 7. Pseudo Inverse Down Thrust

**Inverse bullish pin bar or doji bar** having **low** spread with volume **lower** than previous two --> No supply or lack of supply (**Continuation Signal)**

{% hint style="info" %}
Inverse Bullish Pin Bar; Spread Low; Volume Lower
{% endhint %}

### **8. Inverse Down Thrust**

**Inverse bullish pin bar or doji bar** having **low** spread with ultra-high or above-average **high** volume --> More demand than supply --> Price rise

{% hint style="info" %}
Inver Bullish Pin Bar; Spread Low; Volume High
{% endhint %}

### 9. Failed Effort Selling Climax

**Higher spread** than previous with **higher volume** than previous, next candle is bullish, absorbing the entire bearish effort&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Spread Higher; Volume Higher
{% endhint %}

## Sign of Weakness (SOW)

Buyer exhausted (demand low) after uptrend and Seller increase (Supply increase) --> Market fall

### 1. Up Thrust

**Bearish pin bar or doji bar** with **low spread** with **ultra-high volume** --> More supply than demand

### 2. Buying Climax

**High Spread Bullish Candle** with upward rejection wick with **ultra-high** volume

### 3. Bullish Effort < Bullish Result

**Spread** is **larger** than previous but **volume** is **lower** than previous&#x20;

### 4. Bullish Effort > Bullish Result

**Bullish candle** with **Spread** **lower** and **volume** **higher**

### 5. No Demand Bar

**Low Spread bullish candle** with **upward** wick (Lower wick is longer than upper wick --> Price go up) with **lower** **volume** than previous two (**Continuation Signal**)

### 6. Pseudo Up Thrust

**Bearish Pin Bar or doji bar** with **low** **spreads** with volume **lower** than previous two (**Continuation**)

### 7. Inverse Pseudo Up Thrust

**Inverse Bearish Pin Bar or doji bar** with **low spreads** with **lower** volume than previous two (**Continuation, Effective after Bearish Momentum**)

### 8. Inverse Up Thrust

**Inverse Bearish Pin Bar** or doji bar with **low** spreads with **high** volume --> More supply than demand

### 9. Failed Effort Buying Climax

Higher spread than previous with volume also higher than previous, and next candle is bearish, absorbing the entire bullish effort
