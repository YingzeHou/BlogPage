# Web Design

## Designing for Desktop

### WIMP Paradigm:

Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointers

#### Windows:

Resizable containers of individual applications

* Primary: for the main functionality, like canvas
* Secondary: main windows through modal panes, dialog boxes, etc.

#### Window Organization:

Organized in a way that overlaps several windows or tiles them across the screen

#### Window Structure:

Windows bring together dedicated panes in different configurations

* Secondary windows can be stacked, docked, and floating

#### Menus:

Menus list all the functions of an application. Menu lists serve educational and reference purpose

#### Toolbars, Palettes, Sidebars, and Tooltips

Facilitate access to frequently used functions

#### Tool Palettes (Not always shown, unlike toolbars, have to click in things to be shown)

Provide advanced controls for particular function rather than frequently accessed functions

#### Pointing

On an application canvas enables a range of advanced capabilities for direct manipulation

## Designing for Web

**Desktop:** Dynamic, persistent screens and suppporting components that enable users to perform complex tasks

**Webpages**: Interconnected pages with aids that help users to navigate and access a large body of contents

Single-page applicatoin (SPA) provides the functions of a desktop application on a webpage following the conventions of desktop applications

#### The Page

Building block of web content, use primary and secondary navigation aids

#### Primary Navigation Aids

Take the form of menus/menubars and reflect the major areas or sections of a website

#### Secondary Navigation Aids

Provide comprehensive links to specific content on the site as fat navigation (a pop window with a lot of content expanded), left-hand navigation, footer navigation, etc.

#### Get back to home

_Breadcrumbs (trace of menu clicks by the user)_ and _hierarchical lists (similar to left-hand secondary navigation, use tabs and indent to show the hierarchy)_ are solutions

#### Organizing Page Content: The Fold

The dividing line between the area that is visible when a page first loads and the remainder of the page

#### Fitting it all in

Large volumns of content is either broken into discrete pages through pagination or incrementally loaded through infinite scroll

#### Search

An alternative to page navigation, provides users with listings of content based on a search query (auto-completion, auto-correction)

#### Faceted search

Helps user narrow down a search once results are returned based on a simple query by providing functions to sort and filter
