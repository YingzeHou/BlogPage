## Dialogflow Building Block, 1

### Intent

Intents are the goals of the user that are expressed to the agent. In the previous examples, despite their different framing, the user was expressing a desire to know what the weather will be. That is their intent

### Entities

Sometimes, users' intents are more specific, and have an intent based around a certain item or entity.

Entities allow for more specificity of requests, without exploding the intent space

**What is the weather like today in Seattle?**

The **intent**: weather inquiry; **entity**: Seattle
